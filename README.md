Livestream Scoreboard for PUBG tournaments
The PUBG Scoreboard is a scoreboard used in PUBG private or public tournaments. It comes wrapped in a simple jQuery project that can be used without a webserver and has a customisable UI for those who want to livestream the competition results.

PUBG Tournaments are typically held in private ROOMS by various streamers or game fans. In PUBG Mobile, rooms are used to host custom matches in which the player who creates the room can customize the map, perspective, and team composition (duos or squads). The room is open to everyone who has the Room ID and password. They benefit from this solution since it allows them to have a structured and automated placement based on team total points. As the event organizer, you have the option of saving the tournament results for later use or for your own personal achievements.

Esports, short for electronic sports, is a type of video game competition. Esports are usually organized multiplayer video game events between professional players, either individually or in teams. Although organized tournaments have long been a feature of video game culture, they were mostly between amateurs until the late 2000s, when professional gamers began to participate and spectatorship of these events via live streaming skyrocketed. Esports has become a prominent part of the video game industry by the 2010s, with many game makers actively designing and supporting tournaments and other events.
